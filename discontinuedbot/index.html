<h1>Hey Everyone!</h1>
<br>
<h3>I decided to completely stop working on the Pet Simulator API bot as Discord flat-out denied my Bot Verification
request and I permanently cannot verify this bot anymore, ever, without any reason.
  <br>
  This essentially means that I will not be able to ever, under any circumstances, grow the bot beyond 100 servers.
<br><br>
I also started a project I want to focus on more, my own Minecraft Server. I am not going to go too in-depth through it in this document, but the website is <a href="https://crafthaven.net/">crafthaven.net</a> if you want to check it out.
<br><br>
Either way, I do not have enough time and dedication to continue developing this bot, so if you want to continue instead, and have enough patience and knowledge to work with <br>BotGhost, here are the codes to each individual
command so you can import it yourself. I am passing the torch.

<h1>Thank you everyone who invited my great bot to their servers and tried it out!</h1><br>
