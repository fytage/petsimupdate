<h1>Hey Everyone!</h1>

<h3>I decided to completely stop working on the Pet Simulator API bot as Discord flat-out denied my Bot Verification
request and I permanently cannot verify this bot anymore, ever, without any reason.

I also started a project I want to focus on more, my own Minecraft Server. I am not going to go too in-depth through it in this document, but the website is <a href="https://crafthaven.net/">crafthaven.net</a> if you want to check it out.

Either way, I do not have enough time and dedication to continue developing this bot, so if you want to continue instead, and have enough patience and knowledge to work with BotGhost, here are the codes to each individual
command so you can import it yourself. I am passing the torch.

<h1>Thank you everyone who invited my great bot to their servers and tried it out!</h1>
